# Python_Maze_Game
- Maze game that I designed for a school project that generates a maze and allows a user to move through it using a sprite.
- I used the BFS/DFS/A* algorithm so that the maze is able to solve itself if the user is unable to do so themselves
- I used the randomised DFS algorithm in order to render a different maze every time the user wants to play a new game
- The maze can vary in size, and can go from a 10x10 to a 50x50 maze
- I used the Pygame library in order to generate the windows and the graphics for all the different functionalities
- I implemented a timer alongside the maze so that the user can see if they are able to solve the maze in a fast time, giving them an incentive to do better
- I also implemented a leaderboard system that stores the time at which the user takes to solve a maze as well as a login system that allows for you to store the times
